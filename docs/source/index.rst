Target-Approximation-Model
**************************
`TargetApproximationModel` (TAM) is a python package that implements the framework of target approximation initially developed by Yi Xu in order to describe pitch contours and later extended by Peter Birkholz to describe the movements of articulators during speech production. 

For a quick introduction to the python package, please refer to the :doc:`tutorial`.
